# ATM Management System (C++ Project)

This project is a console-based ATM system built in C++ that simulates the core features of basic banking. It allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and perform common financial operations. The system stores each user account in a separate text file, which includes personal details, balance information, and a full transaction history.

Users can deposit money, withdraw money with balance and limit checks, view their current balance, and review up to fifty recent transactions. Every action is recorded with a timestamp so the history remains accurate and easy to track. The program includes validation for input errors, withdrawal and deposit limits, and a maximum number of login attempts to reduce misuse.

There is also a simple admin panel section reserved for future features such as listing all accounts or reviewing account records. The interface uses organized menus, colored console messages, and clear prompts to keep the system easy to navigate even for beginners.

This project is useful for students learning file handling, structures, functions, basic authentication logic, and menu-driven program design in C++. It also provides a foundation that can be expanded into a more advanced banking application by adding encryption, database storage, or stronger admin controls.
